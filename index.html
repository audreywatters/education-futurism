<p>Education Futurism used to be a publication on Medium. It's been deleted (although my stories are still available there, just without the custom domain). I have opted not to renew educationfuturism.com. It will expire in 2018.</p>

<p>If you are interested in stories about the history of the future of education, visit the <a href="http://teachingmachin.es">Teaching Machines</a> website, where you can find links to the original articles posted on <a href="http://hackeducation.com">Hack Education</a>.</p>
